# SQL Memoirs – Mentor Edition

Developer-level documentation for PostgreSQL environments, focused on structured SQL logic and reproducible queries.  
Created as part of preparation for the W3C SQL Developer Professional certification.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Document standardized SQL patterns and query structures
- Support exam preparation with audit-ready examples
- Promote developer-level thinking around normalization, data integrity, and query logic
- Provide reusable structures for PostgreSQL workflows

This is not a tutorial, not a training resource, and not designed for beginners.  
It is a technical documentation project aimed at developers working beyond basic SQL.

## ⚙️ Platform

- PostgreSQL 14+
- Debian-based Linux distributions
- CLI-based workflows using `psql`

## 📚 Exam Context

This repository aligns with the W3C SQL Developer Professional exam topics.  
Examples are structured for auditability and reproducibility, not for onboarding or teaching.
